Q: Relative difference in timing results with repect to looping verses
recursion for iteration:

The user time of running a recursive code is significantly larger than
the user time of running a looping code. This is because in recursive code,
the variables in previous recursion are kept in next recursion, and keep building 
new stack frame, and the previous variabls are substitute again and again into the 
same program.
However, in looping code, every iteral is keep updating variables, and the previous
variables do not need to be substitute into the whole program again. This is the reason
of difference in running time of looping code and recursive code. 

Q: Performance difference when compiler optimization is used:

When compiler optimization is used, the runing time of recursive code decreasing 
significantly. However, the running time of looping code has only a tiny decrease.
This is because the compiler starts to reduce the cost of running this program and 
use tail recursion instead of the normal recursion, which cost less time.
