user time for "g++ nostaticexits.cc" (transformed program):

user time for "g++ nostaticexits.cc" (given program):
4.01s
user time for "g++ -O2 nostaticexits.cc" (transformed program):
1.62s
user time for "g++ -O2 nostaticexits.cc" (given program):

Q: Relative difference in timing results with original and transformed program:

The run time of transformed program is significantly longer than original
program. This is because "EXIT" expression exits the loop immediately and prints
out characters in original program. However, there is no exit spot in transformed
program, and the processor must complete the whole loop in order to continue running.
In addition, the flag value accounts for spaces in stacks and reading in flag value
and compare it with integers is also a time cosuming progress.

Q: Performance difference when compiler optimization is used:

The run tiem of transformed program and original program both reduce significantl.
However, the run time of transformed program decreases the most and has almost the
same time cosuming as original program.
